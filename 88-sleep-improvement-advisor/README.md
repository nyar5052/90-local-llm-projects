## 📋 Overview

A comprehensive sleep improvement tool that analyzes sleep logs, calculates sleep scores, builds bedtime routines, assesses sleep environments, identifies weekly patterns, and provides AI-powered recommendations — all running privately on your machine.

Built as part of the **Local LLM Projects** series (Project #88/90), this tool demonstrates how AI can be applied to healthcare education while maintaining complete data privacy through local model inference.

### Why This Project?

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 📊 | **Sleep Scoring** | 0-100 composite score based on duration, quality, consistency, and wake count |
| 📈 | **Pattern Analysis** | Day-of-week analysis, weekday vs weekend comparison, trend detection |
| 🌙 | **Bedtime Routines** | Personalized 2-hour wind-down routine with 9 timed activities |
| 🏠 | **Environment Check** | 11-item checklist across Light, Sound, Temperature, Bedding, Air, Electronics |
| 📋 | **Sleep Assessment** | 10-question interactive assessment covering all sleep factors |
| 📉 | **Sleep Statistics** | Average, min, max duration and quality from CSV sleep logs |

## 🔄 Local vs Cloud Comparison

| Aspect | Local LLM (This Tool) | Cloud API |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Privacy** | ✅ 100% local — data never leaves your machine | ❌ Data sent to external servers |
| **Cost** | ✅ Free after setup | ❌ Pay per API call |
| **Speed** | ⚡ Depends on hardware | ⚡ Generally fast |
| **Internet** | ✅ Works offline | ❌ Requires connection |
| **Data Control** | ✅ Complete control | ❌ Third-party storage |
| **HIPAA Concerns** | ✅ No data transmission | ⚠️ BAA required |
| **Model Updates** | 🔄 Manual model pulls | ✅ Automatic updates |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Limited by hardware | ✅ Cloud-scale |

> 🔒 **For healthcare data, local LLM inference eliminates the risk of sensitive information exposure through network transmission.**

## ❓ FAQ

<details>
<summary><strong>Can this diagnose sleep disorders?</strong></summary>
<br>

Absolutely NOT. This tool provides general sleep hygiene suggestions. Sleep disorders like sleep apnea, insomnia, or narcolepsy require professional diagnosis through sleep studies conducted by certified sleep medicine physicians.

> ⚠️ **Reminder**: This tool is for educational purposes only. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How reliable is the sleep score?</strong></summary>
<br>

The sleep score is a general wellness indicator based on self-reported data. It is NOT a clinical measurement. Factors like sleep stages, breathing patterns, and neurological activity require medical-grade sleep monitoring.

> ⚠️ **Reminder**: This tool is for educational purposes only. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I stop my sleep medication based on this advice?</strong></summary>
<br>

NEVER change or stop medication without consulting your prescribing physician. This tool provides general sleep hygiene tips, not medical treatment plans.

> ⚠️ **Reminder**: This tool is for educational purposes only. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I use the CSV format with my sleep tracker?</strong></summary>
<br>

The tool expects CSV with columns: date, bedtime, waketime, quality_rating, notes. You may need to export and format data from commercial sleep trackers to match this format.

> ⚠️ **Reminder**: This tool is for educational purposes only. Always consult qualified healthcare professionals.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the bedtime routine evidence-based?</strong></summary>
<br>

The routine activities are based on general sleep hygiene principles widely recommended by sleep researchers. However, individual effectiveness varies. Consult a sleep specialist for persistent sleep issues.
