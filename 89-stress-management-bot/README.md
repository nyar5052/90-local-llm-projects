## 🔄 Local vs Cloud Comparison

| Aspect | Local LLM (This Tool) | Cloud API |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Privacy** | ✅ 100% local — data never leaves your machine | ❌ Data sent to external servers |
| **Cost** | ✅ Free after setup | ❌ Pay per API call |
| **Speed** | ⚡ Depends on hardware | ⚡ Generally fast |
| **Internet** | ✅ Works offline | ❌ Requires connection |
| **Data Control** | ✅ Complete control | ❌ Third-party storage |
| **HIPAA Concerns** | ✅ No data transmission | ⚠️ BAA required |
| **Model Updates** | 🔄 Manual model pulls | ✅ Automatic updates |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Limited by hardware | ✅ Cloud-scale |

> 🔒 **For healthcare data, local LLM inference eliminates the risk of sensitive information exposure through network transmission.**
