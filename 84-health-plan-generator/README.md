## 📋 Overview

A personalized health and wellness plan generator that creates adaptive plans based on your goals, age, and lifestyle — with progress tracking, weekly check-ins, and milestone-based recommendations, all powered by local LLMs.

Built as part of the **Local LLM Projects** series (Project #84/90), this tool demonstrates how AI can be applied to healthcare education while maintaining complete data privacy through local model inference.

### Why This Project?

| | Feature | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 🎯 | **5 Goal Types** | Weight loss, better sleep, fitness, stress management, general wellness |
| 📈 | **Progress Tracking** | Serializable ProgressTracker with JSON persistence |
| ✅ | **Weekly Check-ins** | 9-question questionnaire for adaptive plan adjustment |
| 🏆 | **Milestones** | Week-by-week milestone tracking for each goal type |
| 🤖 | **Adaptive AI** | Plans evolve based on your progress and feedback |
| 👤 | **Personalized** | Tailored to age, lifestyle, duration, and specific goals |

## 🔄 Local vs Cloud Comparison

| Aspect | Local LLM (This Tool) | Cloud API |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Privacy** | ✅ 100% local — data never leaves your machine | ❌ Data sent to external servers |
| **Cost** | ✅ Free after setup | ❌ Pay per API call |
| **Speed** | ⚡ Depends on hardware | ⚡ Generally fast |
| **Internet** | ✅ Works offline | ❌ Requires connection |
| **Data Control** | ✅ Complete control | ❌ Third-party storage |
| **HIPAA Concerns** | ✅ No data transmission | ⚠️ BAA required |
| **Model Updates** | 🔄 Manual model pulls | ✅ Automatic updates |
| **Scalability** | ⚠️ Limited by hardware | ✅ Cloud-scale |

> 🔒 **For healthcare data, local LLM inference eliminates the risk of sensitive information exposure through network transmission.**
